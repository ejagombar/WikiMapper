Currently, I am focusing on developing a method to quickly parse the ~100GB Wikipedia XML dump file.

## Aims
- [x] Parse the XML file, extracting page names and links
- [x] Analyse performance using GProf
- [x] Parallelise the parser.
- [x] Import data into Neo4j using Neo4j-Admin-Import
- [ ] Setup a third party visual Neo4j graph database explorer
- [ ] Develop a custom graph storage library
- [ ] Develop a custom viewer to visualise the data.
